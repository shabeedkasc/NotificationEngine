# üöÄ Getting started 

Implementations to keep in mind.
### `User Action Logging`

To log user action, do the following:

1. In a modules' file, import the user action logging service function.

```javascript
const userActionService = require("../userAction/userActionService");
```

2. In the method where a new action is to be logged; define the parameters.

```javascript
 let actionparam={req:req,Content:'PARAMETERS, PASSED',Route:'/some/route',Action:'A new user action has been logged'}
```

3. Call the action logging function.


```javascript
userActionService.AddUserAction(actionparam);
```

### `Error Logging`

To ensure errors are logged, do the following:

1. In a modules' controller file, import the error logging function.

```javascript
const logError = require("../../utils/logger/errorFunction");
```

2. In the catch block, call the error logging function.

```javascript
try{
    //YOUR CODE HERE
}
catch(error){
return logError(error.message, error.stack,"filename.js", "/some/route");
}
```
